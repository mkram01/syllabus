### `R` and RStudio

The primary tool we will use for data manipulation and analysis is the programming language `R`. `R` is open-source, freely available, and highly extensible analysis environment. We’ll use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) as the “front end” for our analyses. RStudio makes it easier to write `R` code and to produce well documented analyses. Like the `R` programming language itself, RStudio is freely available.

Regardless if you are going to use RStudio on your computer or in our classroom, you have two options available for accessing the software: 

1. Download `R`, RStudio, and the necessary packages manually and manage your own installation of these tools.
2. Access `R` and RStudio via [Docker](https://www.docker.com), a tool for creating virtual computing environments.

Students who are not sure whether they will use `R` past this semester, or who are less comfortable with computers, are urged to access `R` via Docker. Students who have more comfort with computers and who already are `R` users or plan to continue using `R` after the semester should consider managing their own installation of these tools.

Detailed instructions are available for both options on the [course website](https://slu-soc5050.github.io/course-software/).
