["course-introduction.html", "Section 1 Course Introduction", " Section 1 Course Introduction Figures often beguile me, particularly when I have the arranging of them myself; in which case the remark attributed to Disraeli would often apply with justice and force: ‘There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics’. Mark Twain (1906) This course provides an introduction to applied statistical analysis for both undergraduate and graduate students with an emphasis placed on statistical techniques that are most common in the sociological literature. The statistical techniques introduced include measures of central tendency and dispersion as well as measures of bi-variate association. Multivariate statistical analyses are also introduced along with essential skills for cleaning data, creating plots, and reporting results. While the examples may be specific to the social sciences, the theories and skills that are covered are broadly applicable across academic disciplines. "],
["course-objectives.html", "1.1 Course Objectives", " 1.1 Course Objectives This course has four intertwined objectives. After completing the course, students will be able to: Fundamentals of inferential statistics: Describe the use of various statistical tests, their requirements and assumptions, and their interpretation; execute these tests both by hand and programmatically using R. Fundamentals of data analysis: Perform basic data cleaning and analysis tasks programmatically using R in ways that support high quality documentation and replication. Fundamentals of data visualization: Create and present publication quality plots programmatically using R and ggplot2. Quantitative research synthesis: Plan, implement (using R), and present (using LaTeX and the presentation software of your choice) a research project that uses linear regression to answer a research question.

["core-resources.html", "1.2 Core Resources", " 1.2 Core Resources There are two core documents and resources for this course. This Syllabus sets out core expectations and policies for the course - i.e. what is required for this course.. It includes a Reading List that contains topics, readings (both required and optional), and assignment due dates for each week. Once the semester starts, these documents will only be updated if a schedule change is necessary. In addition to these documents, regular updates will be provided on the course website. Each lecture will have a corresponding page on the site that includes links to handouts, YouTube videos, sample code, and additional descriptions of concepts covered in class. If bugs or issues arise, they will be documented along with solutions here as well. Please check the website regularly for updates and new content. "],
["readings.html", "1.3 Readings", " 1.3 Readings There are three books required for this course with an optional fourth book. Each book has been selected to correspond with one or more of the course objectives. The books are: Diez, David M., Christopher D Barr, and Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel-Runde. 2015. OpenIntro Statistics. 3rd edition. OpenIntro. This book is not available from the Bookstore. You can download a free copy or purchase a physical copy from Amazon (black &amp; white or color). Prener, Christopher. 2018. Sociospatial Data Science. This book is not available from the Bookstore. You can access it as a webbook and download it as a .pdf here. Wheelan, Charles. 2014. Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data. New York, NY: W. W. Norton &amp; Company. This book can be purchased in the bookstore or online. Ebook versions are available. Wickham, Hadley and Garrett Grolemund. 2017. R for Data Science. O’Reily Media: Sebastopol, CA. This book book can be purchased in the bookstore, online, or accessed for free as a webbook. I do not require students to buy physical copies of texts. You are free to select a means for accessing these texts that meets your budget and learning style. If ebook editions (e.g. Kindle, iBooks, pdf, etc.) of texts are available, they are acceptable for this course. All texts should be obtained in the edition noted above. All readings are listed on the Reading List and should be completed before the course meeting on the week in which they are assigned. Full text versions of most readings not found in the books assigned for the course can be obtained using the library’s Electronic Reserves system. The password for the Electric Reserves will be posted on Slack at the beginning of the semester. "],
["services.html", "1.4 Services", " 1.4 Services Over the course of the semester, we’ll use three web-based services. Each of these will require you to create an account with a username and password. GitHub will require you to enable two-factor authentication as well, and you should also enable this for Slack. I strongly recommend using a password manager. All of these services have free tiers as well as premium features that require a monthly subscription. None of these premium features are required for this course - what you can access for free is all the functionality you will need! 1.4.1 GitHub The majority of course content (sample code, documentation, and assignments) for this course will be made available using GitHub. GitHub is a website used by programmers, data analysts, and researchers to share computer code and projects. GitHub will also be used for assignment submission and feedback. In addition to providing us with platform for hosting course content, using GitHub will give you experience in some of the techniques that researchers use to conduct both open-source and collaborative research. GitHub is free to use but does have some premium features, which students can access for free through their Student Developer program. As I noted above, these premium features are not required for this course but are worth knowing about if you decide to continue using GitHub. 1.4.2 Slack We will be utilizing the communication service Slack to stay in touch. Slack allows me to post announcements and updates about the course that you will receive alerts to. Any changes to our course GitHub repositories will also be posted there automatically. Slack will also provide us with a space to host virtual office hours. This allows students to monitor the types of questions and issues that are arising, and learn from each other’s experiences. Slack can be accessed via a web browser or you can optionally install mobile as well as desktop applications available for both Windows and macOS. 1.4.3 ShareLaTeX Finally, we’ll use a free web service called ShareLaTeX to create documents using the markup language LaTeX. Students’ final projects will need to incorporate LaTeX deliverables. While LaTeX can be downloaded and installed, learning LaTeX online takes away some of the initial challenges with getting a LaTeX installation up and running. It will also allow me to help trouble-shoot issues remotely. In July 2017, ShareLaTeX joined forces with their primary competitor, Overleaf. Eventually one or both of these services may disappear, so there may be changes in how we access LaTeX mid-semester. "],
["software.html", "1.5 Software", " 1.5 Software There are two principle applications we’ll be using this semester in addition to the services listed previously: RStudio and GitHub Desktop. Both of these are open-source applications that can be downloaded and used without cost. Both applications are available in our classroom, which you will have 24-hour access to throughout the semester. 1.5.1 R and RStudio The primary tool we will use for data manipulation and analysis is the programming language R. R is open-source, freely available, and highly extensible analysis environment. We’ll use RStudio as the “front end” for our analyses. RStudio makes it easier to write R code and to produce well documented analyses. Like the R programming language itself, RStudio is freely available. Regardless if you are going to use RStudio on your computer or in our classroom, you have two options available for accessing the software: Download R, RStudio, and the necessary packages manually and manage your own installation of these tools. Access R and RStudio via Docker, a tool for creating virtual computing enviornments. Students who are not sure whether they will use R past this semester, or who are less comfortable with computers, are urged to access R via Docker. Students who have more comfort with computers and who already are R users or plan to continue using R after the semester should consider managing their own installation of these tools. Detailed instructions are available for both options on the course website. 1.5.2 GitHub Desktop You will need another free application called GitHub Desktop. This program allows you to easily copy data from GitHub onto your computer. It also makes it easy to upload files like labs and problem sets to GitHub. If you have already used Git via the command line, you can continue to do so without utilizing GitHub Desktop. "],
["course-policies.html", "Section 2 Course Policies", " Section 2 Course Policies My priority is that class periods are productive learning experiences for all students. In order to foster this type of productive environment, I ask students to follow a few general policies and expectations: Work each week to contribute to a positive, supportive, welcoming, and compassionate class enviornment. Arrive to class on time and stay for the entire class period. Silence all electronic devices before entering the classroom. Do not engage in side conversations. This is disrespectful to the speaker (whether me or a classmate), and can affect the ability of others in the class to learn. Be respectful of your fellow classmates. Do not interrupt when someone is speaking, monopolize the conversation, or belittle the ideas or opinions of others. Complete the assigned readings for each class in advance, and come prepared with discussion points and questions. The following sections contain additional details about specific course policies related to attendance, participation, electronic device use, student support, academic honesty, and Title IX. "],
["compassionate-coursework.html", "2.1 Compassionate Coursework", " 2.1 Compassionate Coursework Being around people who are different from us makes us more creative, more diligent and harder-working Katherine Phillips, 2014 The goal of this course is not just to impart knowledge related to statistics, data science, and programming, but to purposefully create an enviornment where all students feel welcome and supported even as they also feel challenged intellectually. This is especially important in a STEM course, where stress levels can be generally high, particularly for certain groups of students. 2.1.1 Challenges in STEM Coursework Statistics courses, and research methods coursework more generally, can be stressful. This can be true for many reasons. For students who have not had significant mathmatical coursework since High School, or have not written computer code before, that could be enough to treat statistics coursework with aprehension. Within STEM coursework, there may also be other, more pernicious patterns. Men may rate their abilities more strongly than women (Cooper et al. 2018) and students who do not identify as “male” or “white” may not feel like they fit into STEM settings (Ong 2005). This can lead to “imposter syndrome”, a feeling that academic gains are not the result of a students’ abilities and a fear that they will soon be “found out” (Lindemann et al. 2016). These feelings can make STEM coursework particularly isolating for women and students of color (Malone and Barabino 2008, Ong et al. 2011). While attrition rates out of STEM majors are subsantially similar for men and women, there are generally fewer women in these programs to begin with and so losses of female students are particularly concerning (Hill et al. 2010). Attrition at the University level may have second order effects for employers, for whom diversity is a critical piece of their success (Akinnawonu 2017, Diaz-Garcia et al. 2011, Nathan and Lee 2015). 2.1.2 A Compassionate Classroom Addressing these challenges, and producing a compassionate coursework experience for every student, is all of our responsibility. Taking this responsibility seriously is imperative not just for reasons of academic retention and its future implications, but also because we are called to do so by the University’s mission both in our classrooms and in the wider world. While I take a leading role in fostering a welcoming and supportive enviornment, I need each and every student’s help in making that enviornment a reality. To that end, all students should familiarize themselves with Contributor Covenant’s Code of Conduct, which is increasingly included in open source projects. The Code of Conduct lays out expectations for how all students are expected to conduct themselves. I want to emphasize one piece here in the syllabus, which includes concreate examples of things each student can and should do to help create a compassionate class atmosphere: Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include: using welcoming and inclusive language, being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, gracefully accepting constructive criticism, focusing on what is best for the [class], [and] showing empathy towards other community members The degree to which students are positively engaged with our class along these lines will be reflected in participation grades given at the mid and end points of the semester. 2.1.3 Harrassment and Title IX While I have every expectation that each member of the Saint Louis University community is capable and willing to create a compassionate coursework experience, I fully recognize that there may be instances where students fall short of that expectation. Students should generally be aware that: Saint Louis University prohibits harassment because of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, military status, veteran status, gender expression/identity, genetic information, pregnancy, or any other characteristics protected by law. All students should also familiarize themselves with Saint Louis University’s polices on bias, discrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct. In particular, they should be aware of policies on harassment and sexual misconduct: Saint Louis University and its faculty are committed to supporting our students and seeking an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment. If you have encountered any form of sexual misconduct (e.g. sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, domestic or dating violence), we encourage you to report this to the University. If you speak with a faculty member about an incident of misconduct, that faculty member must notify SLU’s Title IX Coordinator, Anna R. Kratky (DuBourg Hall, Room 36; anna.kratky@slu.edu); 314-977-3886) and share the basic facts of your experience with her. The Title IX coordinator will then be available to assist you in understanding all of your options and in connecting you with all possible resources on and off campus. If you wish to speak with a confidential source, you may contact the counselors at the University Counseling Center at 314-977-TALK. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported either directly to the instructor or to the University Administration. Consistent with the above policies, I will forward all reports of inappropriate conduct to the Title IX Coordinator’s office or to the Office of Diversity and Affirmative Action. Please be aware that University policies may require me to forward information about the identity of any students connected to the disclosure. Please also be aware that communications over various online services, including (but not limited to) Slack, GitHub, ShareLaTeX, and Google Apps, are covered by this policy. "],
["attendance-and-participation.html", "2.2 Attendance and Participation", " 2.2 Attendance and Participation Attendance and participation are important components of this course since we only meet once a week. Students are expected to attend all class sessions; missing even one class can create a significant roadblock for many students. Making up missed classes are your responsibility. Please let me know if you will be missing class so that we can touch base about any assignments, and make sure to obtain notes from a classmate. I do post slides to GitHub, but my slides are intended only to serve as references. Please note that lectures and discussions cannot be recorded by any means (e.g. audio or video recordings, or photographs) without my permission. "],
["communication.html", "2.3 Communication", " 2.3 Communication Slack and email are my preferred methods of communication. I am on Slack during workday hours, though I may be “away” during meetings and while I teach my other class. I also may have limited availability on Tuesdays, a day that I am not typically on-campus. I will also monitor Slack during weekday evening hours and will respond to messages if I am able. Likewise, I dedicate time to email responses each workday, meaning that my response time is typically within 24 hours during the workweek. Please use your SLU email account when emailing me. For both email and Slack, if you have not received a response from me after 48 hours (or by end of business on Monday if you messaged me over the weekend), please follow-up to ensure that your message did not get lost in the shuffle. All messages regarding course updates, assignments, and changes to the class schedule, including cancellations, will be posted on the _news channel in Slack. Changes to the class schedule, including cancellations, will also sent to your SLU email account. It is imperative that you check both Slack and your SLU email account regularly. Please also ensure that all concerns or questions about your standing in the course are directed to me immediately. Inquires from parents, SLU staff members, and others will not be honored. "],
["electronic-devices.html", "2.4 Electronic Devices", " 2.4 Electronic Devices During class periods, students are asked to refrain from using electronic devices (including cell phones) for activities not directly related to the course. For this class, I expect students to limit their use of electronic devices to accessing course software, readings, and notes. There is evidence that using electronic devices during lectures results in decreased retention of course content and lower overall course performance. Students who are not using a laptop but are in direct view of another student’s laptop also have decreased performance in courses. Conversely, students who take notes the “old fashioned way” have better performance on tests compared to students who take notes on laptops. I therefore ask students to be conscious of how they are using their devices, the ways such use impacts their own learning, and the effect that it may have on others around them. I reserve the right to alter this policy if electronic device use becomes problematic during the semester. "],
["student-support.html", "2.5 Student Support", " 2.5 Student Support If you meet the eligibility requirements for academic accommodations through the Disability Services office (located within the Student Success Center), you should arrange to discuss your needs with me after the first class. All discussions of this nature are treated confidentially, and I will make every effort to work with you to come up with a plan for successfully completing the course requirements. Please note that I will not provide accommodations to students who are not working with Disability Services. If you are a student-athlete who is in-season, you should discuss your game schedule with me after the first class and share your travel letter with me as soon as you have a copy. You are reminded that games and tournaments are not excuses for failing to complete assignments, and that NCAA rules prohibit student-athletes from missing classes for practice. Low grades that jeopardize eligibility must be addressed immediately by you, not by a coach or academic coordinator. I also encourage you to take advantage of the University Writing Services (UWS) program. Getting feedback benefits writers at all skill levels and the quality of your writing will be reflected in assignment grades. The UWS has trained writing consultants who can help you improve the quality of your written work. UWS’s consultants are available to address everything from brainstorming and developing ideas to crafting strong sentences and documenting sources. "],
["academic-honesty.html", "2.6 Academic Honesty", " 2.6 Academic Honesty All students should familiarize themselves with Saint Louis University’s policies concerning cheating, plagiarism, and other academically dishonest practices: Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible conduct in all academic endeavors. The mission of Saint Louis University is “the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity.” Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and community service via which SLU embodies its mission. The University strives to prepare students for lives of personal and professional integrity, and therefore regards all breaches of academic integrity as matters of serious concern. Any work that is taken from another student, copied from printed material, or copied the internet without proper citation is expressly prohibited. Note that this includes all computer code, narrative text, and documentation written for class assignments - each student is expected to author and de-bug their notebooks and accompanying files. All relevant assignments should include in-text citations and references formatted using the American Psychological Association (APA) style guidelines. Any student who is found to have been academically dishonest in their work risks failing both the assignment and this course. "]
